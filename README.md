# Exam Anxiety Coach

**Industry:** Education / EdTech  
**Part of 30-Day AI App Challenge **

## The Problem
40% of students experience test anxiety that negatively impacts their exam performance. They spend hours studying but freeze during actual tests. Traditional study plans don't account for anxiety triggers or individual stress patterns.

## The Solution
An AI-powered app that generates personalized, anxiety-safe exam preparation plans:

- **Anxiety Assessment** - Quick quiz to identify stress triggers
- **Custom Study Schedule** - AI builds plans around your anxiety patterns
- **Calming Techniques** - Integrated breathing exercises and stress management
- **Progress Tracking** - Monitor anxiety levels as exam approaches
- **Confidence Boosting** - Positive reinforcement and realistic goal-setting

## Why This Requires a Purpose-Built App
General AI tools provide answers, but they work in isolated conversations. Exam anxiety needs continuity, personalization, and trust built over time.
A dedicated app turns guidance into a system—remembering past inputs, adapting plans, and delivering support through a calming, student-friendly interface. This creates structure, emotional connection, and consistency, which are essential for real progress.

## Who This Is For
- High school students preparing for AP exams or SATs
- College students facing midterms and finals
- Professional certification test-takers
- Anyone who experiences test anxiety

## What I Learned
Building apps that address mental health requires careful UX design. The app needs to feel calming from the first interaction - color choices, pacing, language all matter. The AI can't just be "smart," it needs to be empathetic.
