# Exam Anxiety Coach

**Industry:** Education / EdTech  
**Part of 30-Day AI App Challenge **

## The Problem
40% of students experience test anxiety that negatively impacts their exam performance. They spend hours studying but freeze during actual tests. Traditional study plans don't account for anxiety triggers or individual stress patterns.

## The Solution
An AI-powered app that generates personalized, anxiety-safe exam preparation plans:

- **Anxiety Assessment** - Quick quiz to identify stress triggers
- **Custom Study Schedule** - AI builds plans around your anxiety patterns
- **Calming Techniques** - Integrated breathing exercises and stress management
- **Progress Tracking** - Monitor anxiety levels as exam approaches
- **Confidence Boosting** - Positive reinforcement and realistic goal-setting

## Why This Can't Be Done in ChatGPT
Requires persistent anxiety tracking across multiple sessions, personalized plan adjustments based on progress data, and integration of calming techniques timed to student's stress levels. ChatGPT can give generic study advice but can't track individual anxiety patterns over time.

## Who This Is For
- High school students preparing for AP exams or SATs
- College students facing midterms and finals
- Professional certification test-takers
- Anyone who experiences test anxiety

## Tools Used
- **Google AI Studio** (Gemini 2.5 Flash) - AI logic and plan generation
- **Google Stitch** - UI design and prototyping
- **React + TypeScript** - Frontend framework

## Time to Build
⏱️ 20 minutes (from concept to working prototype)

## Revenue Potential
$9-19/month per student
- Students pay for exam prep apps ($15-50/month average)
- Mental health + education combo = high perceived value
- Recurring revenue during academic year

## Key Features
1. Personalized anxiety assessment
2. AI-generated study schedules that adapt to stress levels
3. Built-in calming exercises (breathing, visualization)
4. Progress tracking with anxiety reduction metrics
5. Exam day preparation checklist

## What I Learned
Building apps that address mental health requires careful UX design. The app needs to feel calming from the first interaction - color choices, pacing, language all matter. The AI can't just be "smart," it needs to be empathetic.
